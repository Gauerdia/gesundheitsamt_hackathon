# Hackathon - Prototype - Gesundheitsamt

The local health department hosted an hackathon, providing different challenges for the
participants to tackle. This repository shows the platform solution proposed for this
use case.

## Idea

The idea is to give the citizens a platform solution that combines on the one hand a
direct link to the health department for urgent or convenient communication and on the
other hand a general storage for all health related information. It also implements
a radar for new physicists and emergency numbers that help in dire situations.

Additionally, the idea of a gamification functionality was proposed. I.e., different
prevention games and quizzes were designed that would make use of the rising interest
of young people in apps that motivate them to use them daily but briefly.

## Technology

Everything is developed with dart and flutter. It is deployable for Android as well as
iOS. The internet access works via google apis and the storage on the device works via Hive.
